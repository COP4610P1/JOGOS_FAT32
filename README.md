## List of implemented commands
 - exit
 - info
 - size
 - ls
 - cd
 - creat
 - mkdir
 - mv
 - rm
 - cp  

## Bugs
 - generally every function implemented works before you do a creat or mkdir
 - ls does becomes bugy after several creat and mkdir calls. Apart from this the ls command works
 - cd does not allow you to go backwards only forwards


## Division of Labor
 - We each worked together to develop the exit, info and size fat_functions
 - Orlando developed the ls and cd functions
 - Justin developed the rm function
 - Orlando and Justin worked together to develop the creat, mkdir, mv, and cp functions
